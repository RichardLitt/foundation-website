### Open Collective Foundation is creating legal, financial, and technical commons for the Solidarity Economy movement.

We have a unique role to play as steward of a legal, financial, and technical commons—a piece of shared infrastructure—that is resonating deeply with the [Solidarity Economy movement](https://neweconomy.net/solidarity-economy/). We can build bridges between 501(c)(3) fiscal sponsorship, the open source community (where we have deep roots), mutual aid groups (100+ are hosted by OCF today), and the movement at large.

Solidarity is our guiding principle at Open Collective Foundation. We practice what we preach. Here are some ways that transparency (“Open”) and shared work (“Collective”) are embodied and by us, the people you will meet at OCF:

- We set our salaries together and account for responsibility level, as well as debt, disability, disadvantage, and dependents, and more – more about that, here.
- We practice [distributed leadership](https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/how-to-grow-distributed-leadership-7f6b25f0361c).
- We set our own schedules, to balance care for ourselves and our communities with our accountability and service to collectives.
- We have a fund for learning and coaching to support individual growth.
- We use a stewardship model where each person on the team supports one other person in their growth.
- We use a [teal organizational model](https://reinventingorganizationswiki.com/en/) that aims to balance autonomy and collaboration.

### VALUES

#### Trust & Transparency

- Funders, partners, and Collectives feel safe giving us money to manage.
- We protect our reputation as a shared resource relied on by all our stakeholders.
- Our operational processes and execution reliably live up to expectations.
- We meet needs around liability, risk, professional advice, and compliance.
- We leverage our structures, brand, and track record to unlock funding opportunities.
- While we’re open to experimentation, we remain stable in a changing world.
- Transparency is a big way we build trust, including transparency of our Collectives and of our own operations and governance.
- We trust Collective leaders and give them as much autonomy as possible over their budgets, while ensuring they follow best practice and regulations.
- We act as a bridge between the tech and nonprofit worlds, bringing together grassroots organizers and institutional funders.
- Our platform delivers transparency automatically, in order to drastically increase the real transparency of Collectives and funding.
- We provide engagement and reporting tools that help Collectives build trust with their funders, community, and stakeholders.
- We trust Collectives to autonomously make their own decisions about their money (while ensuring activities meet compliance regulations and maintain trust with their supporters).
- We trust funders to give directly to the Collectives they want to support.

#### Collectivism

- We believe in creating positive impact through creating commons and partnerships.
- Our voice represents all the Collectives under our umbrella, and we use it wisely.
- We support practices and tools that help our Collectives work effectively as collectives (not bottlenecking on a single individual).
- We serve our Collectives both as discrete projects and as a community.
- We choose cooperation above competition, and collaboration above individualism.
- Our structure, legal status, and brand are common resources that we lend to Collectives wherever possible to increase their impact and open doors.
- We believe society at large should also be an equitable collective, and we work to close its many gaps and inequalities.
- For society to function as a collective, we must be dedicated to removing barriers to civic and economic participation, and we see our mission of positive impact through the lens of systemic equity and social justice.

#### Service

- We are here to serve the nonprofit missions of our Collectives and funders; our mission is to amplify their missions.
- We are operationally efficient and our processes enable progress, not slow it down.
- We use technology to empower Collectives, strive to continually improve it, deeply understand it: tech-driven positive impact requires tech-driven fiscal sponsorship.
- We provide comprehensive financial management all on one platform, enabling efficient service.
- We focus on human connection; our business is numbers but people are not just numbers to us.
- We show and admit our own humanity, including imperfections, to authentically serve our mission.
- We put as much power and autonomy as possible in the hands of Collectives, funders, and their communities, to enable them to serve themselves using our tools, while ensuring best practice.
