\* We say 8% because Open Collective Foundation takes 5% for crowdfunding done on the site and third-party payment processors (like Stripe and Paypal) charge separate fees that average 3% on each transaction made using their service. Learn more [here](https://docs.opencollective.foundation/how-it-works/fees). We take 4-8% for bank transfers and checks: 8% for up to 500k raised; 6% for up to 1 million raised; 4% for over a million raised.
